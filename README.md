# Prismic Custom Type Library

A web interface to access a collection of different Prisimic types that can be used in your project.

This is somewhat a work in progress, but naturally it is intended as a place where people could share there designs for content models in the Prismic types.

Obviously, you should share the ones that you are happy with being in the public domain, although you would stay the rightful owner of the tye design and credited with it.

## Usage

The types that have been indexed are listed in a table where you can download the JSON representation of the Custom Type, from there you can copy the file contents into your writing room.

To be able to add a custom type, you can visit the [submit custom type page](https://ptl.vercel.app/types/create). There is a form there where you can upload you copy of the file.

Alternatively, you can create a new issue or a discussion. If you would prefer to PR and add it yourself, please check out the default format of the closed issues labeled 'test'. That will have the expected format :)
